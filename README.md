# rustls_testing
This is for my Summer 2023 Intern Project at Microsoft. This project is for us to create a benchmark test for RusTLS (rustls), a Rust-based TLS client/server codebase using webpki certificate validation, and compare that against using SChannel and other platform-native certificate validation libraries (through rustls-platform-verifier for now).
